## $ whoami

Hi, my name is Chris better known as Naus with a lot of my friends and co-workers. I have been working in the cyber world for more then a decade! I have done everything from pulling the cables, help desk, admin support, networking, as well as design and development. On the side I have been known to have way to many hobbies like 3D printing, home theater audiophile, custom computers, FPV drones, and whiskey can't forget the whiskey! In the past years I have found myself taking my hobbies and building small businesses out of them. NausDesign was my first. I designed and developed for many small company's, everything from branding to full websites. Then came Kinetic Aerial, I took my love for FPV drones and built an online e-commerce's site for custom designed and built drones. This did really well and I ended up selling this company. Then came ethical hacking and the idea of doing bug bounties. So with little to no free time left I crammed in everything hacking I could! I quickly realized the scope was just to wide and I would need more time to get good at this. So I set out not to just do this as my next hobby but as a career. I took this challenge on and told myself in one year I would put myself out there and leave a great networking job for cyber security. With the hard work and support I was able to pull this off and I am now working full time on a red team for Booz Allen. Lets also not forget the family, I am married with two amazing kids, make that three including the doge!


## Site Goals

I would like to continue to develop my skills and use this platform to help other reach their goals and to hold myself accountable. So feel free to bookmark this page and come along the journey with me. I am sure as I grow and change so will this website but currently I hope to make short blogs on many things like my setups, good resources, CTF like www.hackthebox.com and www.tryhackme.com, and just whatever is on the brain for the day!
