## Welcome

With this being my first post I figured the best thing to start out with is my current setup.  This will include my main set up as well as others I have and why I might use one over the other.  Keep in mind just because this is what I use does not mean it is the best set up for you.  My goal here is to give you an idea if your getting started or if your in the market for something new and have questions if this set up is good for you.  I will do my best on detailing it out and in the future updated this with any changes that did or did not benefit me.

## Main Hacking setup

This took me a while to decide on, and I did a lot of research on what would work best for me.  I already had a power house PC in my office and it could do anything I needed it to do, more on that below.  Just one problem it was not portable and I was getting tired of being stuck in my office for hours and hours or in some cases I just cant be in there when watching the kids! So first was looking for a powerful laptop that would support me in ethical hacking, Design and development, and of course day to day task as this would turn into my goto machine for everything.  I ended up setting on a new 2019 16in MacBook Pro, I know some of you are going to wonder why I chose this and trust me I know there are Pro's and Con's to every choice but it came down to how fluid this laptop could perform all my task and support the development environment I needed. 

I run two Profiles on this laptop, one for pure ethical hacking and nothing else, and the other for my everyday use and design work for myself or clients. I like to keep my desktop environments clean and only have applications installed that make sense for use with that profile. So for example I would have Adobe applications on my design profile, but on my hacking profile you would not see Adobe or other design application and only have application like VMware for virtual boxes to test in. Again this is just how I like to be organized and keep separation of work and fun!

### Hardware

* **MacBook Pro**
* 2019 Space Gray
* 16-inch Retina display with True Tone in a 15in body, love it!
* 2.6GHz 6‑core 9th‑generation Intel Core i7 processor, Turbo Boost up to 4.5GHz
* 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 memory (upgraded from the 16 to 32 for VM's)
* AMD Radeon Pro 5500M with 4GB of GDDR6 memory (mid tier upgrade help with VM, and 3d modeling)
* 1TB SSD storage (honestly was going with 512 but they had a better deal on 1TB)
* Four Thunderbolt 3 ports
* Touch Bar and Touch ID
* Removable Samsung T5 SSD 1TB (great for backing everything up as well working off of with its high speeds)

#### Pro's

* Perfect sized screen for proactivity
* Thin, light weight, and great build quality 
* Fast and fluid with all applications I use
* Based on linux so perfect for development
* VMware Fusion run amazing (I have had up to 5 VM's running at one time so far no lag!)
* Battery life!!!

#### Con's
* Pricey for what you could get in a PC like a Dell XPS or equal PC.
* still thinking...lol and I come from a PC world not Mac

### Software

* **VMware Fusion** - this is Super Important in my opinion for setting up safe boxes to hack from or to hack into for training. I Currently run a Kali VM for Ethical Hacking, CTF's, as well as testing new pentesting scrips and more. you can take snapshots any time you plan to do something new and if you mess anything up go back to a safe kali build and your back up and running. I also run a Windows server with Active Directory on it and two other Windows 10 host in VM's to run volubility testing against them. The best thing about running this on the MacBook is with a three finger swipe to the right or left you are back into your Mac OS where you might be running your Notes or other application outside of a VM. Its like beingin three OS's at one time on one machine with instance access to all of them.

* **Kali Linux** - So this really is not a software but I list it here because My main OS is Mac OS and as stated above running an install of Kali on a MV.  So I treat this like a software install.  This is not a must have to be a hacker like many may quote but I do find it an amazing tool to have at your finger tips. I mostly use Kali during CTF's since it comes with just about any hacking tool you might need to complete.  As you get better you may find your self building your own custom Linux distro with only tools you need. 

* **Microsoft OneNote** - Notes are very important, maybe the most important thing while performing any type of ethical hacking or pentesting.  This practice of taking notes will keep you organized, allowing you to refer back to old notes on a new job, or even refer back to notes on a current job to make sure your not repeating work.  I like OneNote because it all backed up on a cloud with easy access, It allows you to make many different note books with sub notes under sub notes! One more thing I run this directly on my Mac OS so if a VM gets corrupt you don't loss any documentation.

* **Burp Suite** - Great for bug bounties or webapp pentesting.

* **Your Browser** - I use a combo of Firefox and Chrome.  Just great to have options when testing different things.  You will spend a huge amount of your time just doing training, CTF's, research, recon, Google fu, and more. Don't under estimate your browser.
