## Welcome

With this being my first post I figured the best thing to start out with is my current setup.  This will include my main set up as well as others I have and why I might use one over the other.  Keep in mind just because this is what I use does not mean it is the best set up for you.  My goal here is to give you an idea if your getting started or if your in the market for something new and have questions if this set up is good for you.  I will do my best on detailing it out with cost included if possible and in the future updated this with any changes that did or did not benefit me.

This took me a while to decide on, and I did a lot of research on what would work best for me.  I already had a power house PC in my office and it could do anything I needed it to do, more on that below.  Just one problem it was not portable and I was getting tired of being stuck in my office for hours and hours or in some cases I just cant be in there when watching the kids! So first was looking for a powerful laptop that would support me in ethical hacking, Design and development, and of course day to day task as this would turn into my goto machine for everything.  I ended up setting on a new 2019 16in Macbook Pro, I know some of you are going to wonder why I chose this and trust me I know there are Pro's and Con's to every choice but it came down to how fluid this laptop could perform all my task and support the development environment I needed. 

I run two Profiles on this laptop, one for pure ethical hacking and nothing else, and the other for my everyday use and design work for myself or clients. I like to keep my desktop environments clean and only have applications installed that make sense for use with that profile. So for example I would have Adobe applications on my design profile, but on my hacking profile you would not see Adobe or other design application and only have application like VMware for virtual boxes to test in. Again this is just how I like to be organized and keep separation of work and fun!
