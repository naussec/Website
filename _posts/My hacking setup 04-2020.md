## Welcome

With this being my first post I figured the best thing to start out with is my current setup.  This will include my main set up as well as others I have and why I might use one over the other.  Keep in mind just because this is what I use does not mean it is the best set up for you.  My goal here is to give you an idea if your getting started or if your in the market for something new and have questions if this set up is good for you.  I will do my best on detailing it out with cost included if possible and in the future updated this with any changes that did or did not benefit me.
